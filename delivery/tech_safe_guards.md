#### What is the Security Series?

```
The security series of papers will provide guidance from the Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) on the rule titled “Security Standards
for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information,” found at 45
CFR Part 160 and Part 164, Subparts A and C, commonly known as the
Security Rule. The Security Rule was adopted to implement provisions of the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). The
series will contain seven papers, each focused on a specific topic related to
the Security Rule. The papers, which cover the topics listed to the left, are
designed to give HIPAA covered entities
insight into the Security Rule, and
assistance with implementation of the
security standards. This series explains
specific requirements, the thought process
behind those requirements, and possible
ways to address the provisions.
```
```
CMS recommends that covered entities read the first paper in this series,
“Security 101 for Covered Entities” before reading the other papers. The
first paper clarifies important Security Rule concepts that will help covered
entities as they plan for implementation. This fourth paper in the series is
devoted to the standards for Technical
Safeguards and their implementation
specifications and assumes the reader has
a basic understanding of the Security
Rule.
```
#### Background

```
Technical safeguards are becoming increasingly more important due to
technology advancements in the health care industry. As technology
improves, new security challenges emerge. Healthcare organizations are faced
with the challenge of protecting electronic protected health information
(EPHI), such as electronic health records, from various internal and external
risks. To reduce risks to EPHI, covered entities must implement technical
safeguards. Implementation of the Technical Safeguards standards

represent good business practices for technology and associated technical
policies and procedures within a covered entity. It is important, and
therefore required by the Security Rule, for a covered entity to comply with
the Technical Safeguard standards and certain implementation
specifications; a covered entity may use any security measures that allow it
to reasonably and appropriately do so.
```
```
The objectives of this paper are to:
```
####  Review each Technical Safeguards standard and implementation

```
specification listed in the Security Rule.
```
####  Discuss the purpose for each standard.

####  Provide sample questions that covered entities may want to

```
consider when implementing the Technical Safeguards.
```
```
Sample questions provided in this paper, and other HIPAA Security Series
papers, are for consideration only and are not required for implementation.
The purpose of the sample questions is to promote review of a covered
entity’s environment in relation to the requirements of the Security Rule.
The sample questions are not HHS interpretations of the requirements of the
Security Rule.
```
#### What are Technical Safeguards?

```
The Security Rule defines technical safeguards in § 164.304 as “the
technology and the policy and procedures for its use that protect electronic
protected health information and control access to it.”
```
```
As outlined in previous papers in this series, the Security Rule is based on
the fundamental concepts of flexibility, scalability and technology
neutrality. Therefore, no specific requirements for types of technology to
implement are identified. The Rule allows a covered entity to use any
security measures that allows it reasonably and appropriately to implement
the standards and implementation specifications. A covered entity must
determine which security measures and specific technologies are reasonable
and appropriate for implementation in its organization.
```
```
45 CFR § 164.306(b), the Security Standards: General Rules, Flexibility of
Approach, provides key guidance for focusing compliance decisions,
including factors a covered entity must consider when selecting security
```

##### STANDARD

```
§ 164.312(a)(1)
```
```
NOTE: For more information
on Information Access
Management, see paper 2 in
this series, “Security Standards
```
- Administrative Safeguards.”

```
NOTE: A covered entity must
establish a balance between
the identifiable risks and
vulnerabilities to EPHI, the cost
of various protective measures
and the size, complexity, and
capabilities of the entity, as
provided in § 164.306(b)(2).
```
measures such as technology solutions. In addition, the
results of the required risk analysis and risk management
processes at §§ 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A) & (B) will also assist the
entity to make informed decisions regarding which security
measures to implement.

The Security Rule does not require specific technology
solutions. In this paper, some security measures and technical solutions are provided as examples
to illustrate the standards and implementation specifications. These are only examples. There
are many technical security tools, products, and solutions that a covered entity may select.
Determining which security measure to implement is a decision that covered entities must make
based on what is reasonable and appropriate for their specific organization, given their own
unique characteristics, as specified in § 164.306(b) the Security Standards: General Rules,
Flexibility of Approach.

Some solutions may be costly, especially for smaller covered
entities. While cost is one factor a covered entity may
consider when deciding on the implementation of a particular
security measure, it is not the only factor. The Security Rule
is clear that reasonable and appropriate security measures
must be implemented, see 45 CFR 164.306(b), and that the
General Requirements of § 164.306(a) must be met.

#### Access Control

The Security Rule defines access in § 164.304 as _“the ability or the means necessary to read,_
write, modify, or communicate data/information or otherwise use any system resource. (This
_definition applies to “access” as used in this subpart, not as used in subpart E of this part_ [the
HIPAA Privacy Rule]). _”_ Access controls provide users with rights and/or privileges to access
and perform functions using information systems, applications, programs, or files. Access
controls should enable authorized users to access the minimum necessary information needed to
perform job functions. Rights and/or privileges should be granted to authorized users based on a
set of access rules that the covered entity is required to
implement as part of § 164.308(a)(4), the Information Access
Management standard under the Administrative Safeguards
section of the Rule.

The Access Control standard requires a covered entity to:

```

Management, see paper 6 in
this series, “Basics of Risk
Analysis and Risk
Management.”
```

```
NOTE: For a discussion on
“required“ and “addressable”
Implementation Specifications,
see the first paper in this series,
“Security 101 for Covered
Entities.”
```
```
“Implement technical policies and procedures for electronic information
systems that maintain electronic protected health information to allow
access only to those persons or software programs that have been granted
access rights as specified in § 164.308(a)(4)[Information Access
Management].”
```
A covered entity can comply with this standard through a combination of access control methods
and technical controls. There are a variety of access control methods and technical controls that
are available within most information systems. The Security Rule does not identify a specific
type of access control method or technology to implement.

Regardless of the technology or information system used,
access controls should be appropriate for the role and/or
function of the workforce member. For example, even
workforce members responsible for monitoring and
administering information systems with EPHI, such as
administrators or super users, must only have access to EPHI
as appropriate for their role and/or job function.

Four implementation specifications are associated with the Access Controls standard.

##### 1. Unique User Identification (Required)

##### 2. Emergency Access Procedure (Required)

##### 3. Automatic Logoff (Addressable)

##### 4. Encryption and Decryption (Addressable)

```
1. UNIQUE USER IDENTIFICATION (R) - § 164.312(a)(2)(i)
The Unique User Identification implementation specification states that a covered entity
must:
```
```
“Assign a uniq ue name and/or number for identifying and tracking user
identity.”
```
```
User identification is a way to identify a specific user of an information system, typically
by name and/or number. A unique user identifier allows an entity to track specific user
activity when that user is logged into an information system. It enables an entity to hold
users accountable for functions performed on information systems with EPHI when
logged into those systems.
```
```
The Rule does not describe or provide a single format for user identification. Covered
entities must determine the best user identification strategy based on their workforce and
```

```
NOTE: Like many of the
Technical Safeguards
implementation specifications,
covered entities may already
have emergency access
procedures in place.
```
operations. Some organizations may use the employee name or a variation of the name
(e.g. jsmith). However, other organizations may choose an alternative such as
assignment of a set of random numbers and characters. A randomly assigned user
identifier is more difficult for an unauthorized user (e.g., a hacker) to guess, but may also
be more difficult for authorized users to remember and management to recognize. The
organization must weigh these factors when making its decision. Regardless of the
format, unlike email addresses, no one other than the user needs to remember the user
identifier.

```
Sample questions for covered entities to consider:
```
##  Does each workforce member have a unique user identifier?

##  What is the current format used for unique user identification?

##  Can the unique user identifier be used to track user activity within

```
information systems that contain EPHI?
```
2. EMERGENCY ACCESS PROCEDURE (R) - § 164.312(a)(2)(ii)
This implementation specification requires a covered entity to:

```
“Establish (and implement as needed) procedures for obtaining necessary
electronic protected health information during an emergency.”
```
These procedures are documented instructions and operational practices for obtaining
access to necessary EPHI during an emergency situation. Access controls are necessary
under emergency conditions, although they may be
very different from those used in normal operational
circumstances. Covered entities must determine the
types of situations that would require emergency
access to an information system or application that
contains EPHI.

Procedures must be established beforehand to instruct
workforce members on possible ways to gain access to needed EPHI in, for example, a
situation in which normal environmental systems, such as electrical power, have been
severely damaged or rendered inoperative due to a natural or manmade disaster.


```
Sample questions for covered entities to consider:
```
##  Who needs access to the EPHI in the event of an emergency?

##  Are there policies and procedures in place to provide appropriate access to

```
EPHI in emergency situations?
```
3. AUTOMATIC LOGOFF (A) - § 164.312(a)(2)(iii)
Where this implementation specification is a reasonable and appropriate safeguard for a
covered entity, the covered entity must:

```
“Implement electronic procedures that terminate an electronic session
after a pre determined time of inactivity.”
```
As a general practice, users should logoff the system they are working on when their
workstation is unattended. However, there will be times when workers may not have the
time, or will not remember, to log off a workstation. Automatic logoff is an effective
way to prevent unauthorized users from accessing EPHI on a workstation when it is left
unattended for a period of time.

Many applications have configuration settings for automatic logoff. After a
predetermined period of inactivity the application will automatically logoff the user.
Some systems that may have more limited capabilities may activate an operating system
screen saver that is password protected after a period of system inactivity. In either case,
the information that was displayed on the screen is no longer accessible to unauthorized
users.

```
Sample questions for covered entities to consider:
```
##  Do current information systems have an automatic logoff capability?

##  Is the automatic logoff feature activated on all workstations with access to

###### EPHI?

4. ENCRYTION AND DECRYPTION (A) - § 164.312(a)(2)(iv)
Where this implementation specification is a reasonable and appropriate safeguard for a
covered entity, the covered entity must:

```
“Implement a mechanism to encrypt and decrypt electronic protected
health information.”
```

##### STANDARD

```
§ 164.312(b)
```
```
NOTE: The goal of encryption
is to protect EPHI from being
accessed and viewed by
unauthorized users.
```
```
Encryption is a method of converting an original
message of regular text into encoded text. The text is
encrypted by means of an algorithm (i.e., type of
procedure or formula). If information is encrypted,
there would be a low probability that anyone other
than the receiving party who has the key to the code or access to another confidential
process would be able to decrypt (i.e., translate) the text and convert it into plain,
comprehensible text.
```
```
There are many different encryption methods and technologies to protect data from being
accessed and viewed by unauthorized users.
```
```
Sample questions for covered entities to consider:
```
##  Which EPHI should be encrypted and decrypted to prevent access by

```
persons or software programs that have not been granted access rights?
```
##  What encryption and decryption mechanisms are reasonable and appropriate

```
to implement to prevent access to EPHI by persons or software programs
that have not been granted access rights?
```
#### Audit Controls

The next standard in the Technical Safeguards section is Audit Controls. This standard has no
implementation specifications. The Audit Controls standard requires a covered entity to:

```
“Implement hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms that
record and examine activity in information systems that contain or use
electronic protected health information.”
```
Most information systems provide some level of audit controls with a reporting method, such as
audit reports. These controls are useful for recording and examining information system activity,
especially when determining if a security violation occurred.

It is important to point out that the Security Rule does not identify data that must be gathered by
the audit controls or how often the audit reports should be reviewed. A covered entity must
consider its risk analysis and organizational factors, such as current technical infrastructure,
hardware and software security capabilities, to determine reasonable and appropriate audit
controls for information systems that contain or use EPHI.


##### STANDARD

```
§ 164.312(c)(1)
```
```
NOTE: The integrity of EPHI
can be compromised by both
technical and non-technical
sources.
```
```
Sample questions for covered entities to consider:
```
##  What audit control mechanisms are reasonable and appropriate to implement

```
so as to record and examine activity in information systems that contain or
use EPHI?
```
##  What are the audit control capabilities of information systems with EPHI?

##  Do the audit controls implemented allow the organization to adhere to

```
policy and procedures developed to comply with the required
implementation specification at § 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(D) for Information
System Activity Review?
```
#### Integrity

The next standard in the Technical Safeguards section is Integrity. Integrity is defined in the
Security Rule, at § 164.304, as _“_ the property that data or information have not been altered or
destroyed in an unauthorized manner. _”_ Protecting the integrity of EPHI is a primary goal of the
Security Rule.

The Integrity standard requires a covered entity to:

```
“Implement policies and procedures to protect electronic protected health
information from improper alteration or destruction.”
```
EPHI that is improperly altered or destroyed can result in
clinical quality problems for a covered entity, including
patient safety issues. The integrity of data can be
compromised by both technical and non-technical sources.
Workforce members or business associates may make
accidental or intentional changes that improperly alter or destroy EPHI. Data can also be altered
or destroyed without human intervention, such as by electronic media errors or failures. The
purpose of this standard is to establish and implement policies and procedures for protecting
EPHI from being compromised regardless of the source.

There is one addressable implementation specification in the Integrity standard.


##### STANDARD

```
§ 164.312(d)
```
###### 1. MECHANISM TO AUTHENTICATE ELECTRONIC PROTECTED HEALTH

```
INFORMATION (A) - § 164.312(c)(2)
Where this implementation specification is a reasonable and appropriate safeguard for a
covered entity, the covered entity must:
```
```
“Implement electronic mechanisms to corroborate that electronic
protected health information has not been altered or destroyed in an
unauthorized manner.”
```
```
In order to determine which electronic mechanisms to implement to ensure that EPHI is
not altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner, a covered entity must consider the
various risks to the integrity of EPHI identified during the risk analysis. Once covered
entities have identified risks to the integrity of their data, they must identify security
measures that will reduce the risks.
```
```
Sample questions for covered entities to consider:
```
##  Do existing information systems have available functions or processes that

```
automatically check for data integrity such as check sum verification or
digital signatures?
```
##  Are electronic mechanisms to protect the integrity of EPHI currently used?

#### Person or Entity Authentication

The Person or Entity Authentication standard has no implementation specifications. This
standard requires a covered entity to:

```
“Implement procedures to verify that a person or entity seeking access to
electronic protected health information is the one claimed.”
```
In general, authentication ensures that a person is in fact who
he or she claims to be before being allowed access to EPHI.
This is accomplished by providing proof of identity. There
are a few basic ways to provide proof of identity for
authentication. A covered entity may:

####  Require something known only to that individual, such as a password or PIN.

```
NOTE: Authentication involves
confirming that users are who
they claim to be.
```

##### STANDARD

```
§ 164.312(e)(1)
```
####  Require something that individuals possess, such as a smart card, a token, or a

```
key.
```
####  Require something unique to the individual such as a biometric. Examples of

```
biometrics include fingerprints, voice patterns, facial patterns or iris patterns.
```
Most covered entities use one of the first two methods of authentication. Many small provider
offices rely on a password or PIN to authenticate the user. If the authentication credentials
entered into an information system match those stored in that system, the user is authenticated.
Once properly authenticated, the user is granted the authorized access privileges to perform
functions and access EPHI. Although the password is the most common way to obtain
authentication to an information system and the easiest to establish, covered entities may want to
explore other authentication methods.

```
Sample questions for covered entities to consider:
```
##  What types of authentication mechanisms are currently used?

##  What level or type of authentication is reasonable and appropriate for each

```
information system with EPHI?
```
##  Are other authentication methods available that may be reasonable and

```
appropriate?
```
#### Transmission Security

The final standard listed in the Technical Safeguards section is Transmission Security. This
standard requires a covered entity to:

```
“Implement technical security measures to guard against unauthorized
access to electronic protected health information that is being transmitted
over an electronic communications network.”
```
In order to determine the technical security measures to implement to comply with this standard,
covered entities must review the current methods used to transmit EPHI. For instance, is EPHI
transmitted through email, over the Internet, or via some form of private or point-to-point
network? Once the methods of transmission are reviewed, the covered entity must identify the
available and appropriate means to protect EPHI as it is transmitted, select appropriate solutions,


and document its decisions. The Security Rule allows for EPHI to be sent over an electronic
open network as long as it is adequately protected.

This standard has two implementation specifications:

##### 1. Integrity Controls (Addressable)

##### 2. Encryption (Addressable)

1. INTEGRITY CONTROLS (A) - § 164.312(e)(2)(i)
Where this implementation specification is a reasonable and appropriate safeguard for a
covered entity, the covered entity must:

```
“Implement security meas ures to ensure that electronically transmitted
electronic protected health information is not improperly modified without
detection until disposed of.”
```
```
Protecting the integrity of EPHI maintained in information systems was discussed
previously in the Integrity standard. Integrity in this context is focused on making sure
the EPHI is not improperly modified during transmission.
```
```
A primary method for protecting the integrity of EPHI being transmitted is through the
use of network communications protocols. In
general, these protocols, among other things, ensure
that the data sent is the same as the data received.
```
```
There are other security measures that can provide
integrity controls for EPHI being transmitted over an
electronic communications network, such as data or
message authentication codes, that a covered entity
may want to consider.
```
```
Sample questions for covered entities to consider:
```
##  What security measures are currently used to protect EPHI during

```
transmission?
```
##  Has the risk analysis identified scenarios that may result in modification to

```
EPHI by unauthorized sources during transmission?
```
```
NOTE: A covered entity should
discuss reasonable and
appropriate security measures
to protect the integrity of EPHI
during transmission with its IT
professionals, vendors,
business associates, and
trading partners.
```

##  What security measures can be implemented to protect EPHI in transmission

```
from unauthorized access?
```
2. ENCRYPTION (A) - § 164.312(e)(2)(ii)
Where this implementation specification is a reasonable and appropriate safeguard for a
covered entity, the covered entity must:

```
“Implement a mechanism to encrypt electronic protected health
informatio n whenever deemed appropriate.”
```
As previously described in the Access Control standard, encryption is a method of
converting an original message of regular text into encoded or unreadable text that is
eventually decrypted into plain comprehensible text. The Encryption implementation
specification is addressable, similar to the addressable implementation specification at §
164.312(a)(2)(iv), which addresses Encryption and Decryption.

There are various types of encryption technology available to covered entities. For an
encryption strategy to be successful, an organization must consider many factors. For
example, for encryption technologies to work properly when data is being transmitted,
both the sender and receiver must be using the same or compatible technology.

Covered entities use open networks such as the Internet and e-mail systems differently.
Currently no single interoperable encryption solution for communicating over open
networks exists. Adopting a single industry-wide
encryption standard in the Security Rule would likely
have placed too high a financial and technical burden
on many covered entities. The Security Rule allows
covered entities the flexibility to determine when,
with whom, and what method of encryption to use.

A covered entity should discuss reasonable and appropriate security measures for the
encryption of EPHI during transmission over electronic communications networks with
its IT professionals, vendors, business associates, and trading partners.

Covered entities must consider the use of encryption for transmitting EPHI, particularly
over the Internet. As business practices and technology change, situations may arise
where EPHI being transmitted from a covered entity would be at significant risk of being
accessed by unauthorized entities. Where risk analysis shows such risk to be significant, a
covered entity must encrypt those transmissions under the addressable implementation
specification for encryption.

```
NOTE: There are various types
of encryption technology. To
work properly, both the sender
and the receiver must use the
same or compatible technology.
```

```
Sample questions for covered entities to consider:
```
##  How does the organization transmit EPHI?

##  How often does the organization transmit EPHI?

##  Based on the risk analysis, is encryption needed to protect EPHI during

```
transmission?
```
##  What methods of encryption will be used to protect the transmission of

###### EPHI?

#### In Summary

The Security Rule Technical Safeguards are the technology and related policies and procedures
that protect EPHI and control access to it. The Technical Safeguards standards apply to all
EPHI. The Rule requires a covered entity to comply with the Technical Safeguards standards
and provides the flexibility to covered entities to determine which technical security measures
will be implemented.

Together with reasonable and appropriate Administrative and Physical Safeguards, successful
implementation of the Technical Safeguards standards will help ensure that a covered entity will
protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of EPHI.


#### Resources

The remaining papers in this series will address other specific topics related to the Security Rule.
The next paper in this series covers the final sections of the Security Rule, Organizational
Requirements and Policies and Procedures and Documentation Requirements.

Covered entities should periodically check the CMS website at [http://www.cms.hhs.gov](http://www.cms.hhs.gov) under
“Regulations and Guidance” for additional information and resources as they work through the
security implementation process. There are many other sources of information available on the
Internet. While CMS does not endorse guidance provided by other organizations, covered
entities may also want to check with other local and national professional health care
organizations, such as national provider and health plan associations for additional information.
